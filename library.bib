abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms have been established so far. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT$^*$ algorithm, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT$^*$ algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},

@article{Warren1989,
abstract = {This paper describes a path planning technique for robotic manipulators and mobile robots in the presence of stationary ob-stacles. The planning consists of applying potential fields around C-Space obstacles and using this field to select a safe path for the robot to follow. The advantage of using potential fields in path planning is that they offer a relatively fast and effective way to solve for safe paths around obstacles. In the method used to accomplish path planning presented here, a trial path is chosen and then modified under the influence of the potential field until an appropriate path is found. By considering the entire path, the problem of being trapped in a local minimum is greatly reduced, allowing the method to be used for global planning. The algo-rithm was tried with success on many different realistic planning problems. The examples in this paper illustrate the algorithm ap-plied t o a two dimensional revolute manipulator, a mobile robot capable of translation only, and a mobile robot capable of both translation and rotation.},

To improve these systems' perceptive speed and robustness, we present SegICP, a novel integrated solution to object recognition and pose estimation. SegICP couples convolutional neural networks and multi-hypothesis point cloud registration to achieve both robust pixel-wise semantic segmentation as well as accurate and real-time 6-DOF pose estimation for relevant objects. Our architecture achieves 1cm position error and <5^\circ$ angle error in real time without an initial seed.

abstract = {We explore global randomized joint-space path planning for articulated robots that are subjected to task-space constraints. This paper describes a representation of constrained motion for joint-space planners and develops two simple and efficient methods for constrained sampling of joint configurations: tangent-space sampling (TS) and first-order retraction (FR). FR is formally proven to provide global sampling for linear task-space transformations. Constrained joint-space planning is important for many real-world problems, which involves redundant manipulators. On the one hand, tasks are designated in workspace coordinates: to rotate doors about fixed axes, to slide drawers along fixed trajectories, or to hold objects level during transport. On the other hand, joint-space planning gives alternative paths that use redundant degrees of freedom (DOFs) to avoid obstacles or satisfy additional goals while performing a task. We demonstrate that our methods are faster and more invariant to parameter choices than the techniques that exist.},

abstract = {Keywords robotics, robot motion planning, sampling-based planning, constraints, planning with constraints, planning for high-dimensional robotic systems Abstract Robots with many degrees of freedom (e.g., humanoid robots and mobile manipulators) have increasingly been employed to ac-complish realistic tasks in domains such as disaster relief, space-craft logistics, and home caretaking. Finding feasible motions for these robots autonomously is essential for their operation. Sampling-based motion planning algorithms have been shown to be effective for these high-dimensional systems. However, incor-porating task constraints (e.g., keeping a cup level, writing on a board) into the planning process introduces significant challenges. This survey describes the families of methods for sampling-based planning with constraints and places them on a spectrum delin-eated by their complexity. Constrained sampling-based meth-ods are based upon two core primitive operations: () sampling constraint-satisfying configurations and () generating constraint-satisfying continuous motion. Although the basics of sampling-based planning are presented for contextual background, the sur-vey focuses on the representation of constraints and sampling-based planners that incorporate constraints.},

abstract = {Robots executing practical tasks in real environments are often subject to multiple constraints. These constraints include orientation constraints: e.g., keeping a glass of water upright, torque constraints: e.g., not exceeding the torque limits for an arm lifting heavy objects, visibility constraints: e.g., keeping an object in view while moving a robot arm, etc. Rejection sampling, Jacobian projection techniques and optimization-based approaches are just some of the methods that have been used to address such constraints while computing motion plans for robots performing manipulation tasks. In this work, we present an approach to handling certain types of constraints in a manner that significantly increases the efficiency of existing methods. Our approach focuses on the sampling step of a motion planner. We implement this step as the drawing of samples from a set that has been computed in advance instead of the direct sampling of constraints. We show how our approach can be applied to different constraints: orientation constraints on the end-effector of an arm, visibility constraints and dual-arm constraints. We present simulated results to validate our method, comparing it to approaches that use direct sampling of constraints.},

@article{Zeng2017,
abstract = {Robot warehouse automation has attracted significant interest in recent years, perhaps most visibly in the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC). A fully autonomous warehouse pick-and-place system requires robust vision that reliably recognizes and locates objects amid cluttered environments, self-occlusions, sensor noise, and a large variety of objects. In this paper we present an approach that leverages multi-view RGB-D data and self-supervised, data-driven learning to overcome those difficulties. The approach was part of the MIT-Princeton Team system that took 3rd- and 4th- place in the stowing and picking tasks, respectively at APC 2016. In the proposed approach, we segment and label multiple views of a scene with a fully convolutional neural network, and then fit pre-scanned 3D object models to the resulting segmentation to get the 6D object pose. Training a deep neural network for segmentation typically requires a large amount of training data. We propose a self-supervised method to generate a large labeled dataset without tedious manual segmentation. We demonstrate that our system can reliably estimate the 6D pose of objects under a variety of scenarios. All code, data, and benchmarks are available at http://apc.cs.princeton.edu/},

CHOMP uses functional gradient techniques to iteratively improve the quality of an initial trajectory, optimizing a functional that trades off between a smoothness and an obstacle avoidance component. CHOMP can be used to locally optimize feasible trajectories, as well as to solve motion planning queries, converging to low-cost trajectories even when initialized with infeasible ones. It uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to alleviate the problem of convergence to high-cost local minima (and for probabilistic completeness), and is capable of respecting hard constraints along the trajectory. We present extensive experiments with CHOMP on manipulation and locomotion tasks, using seven-degree-of-freedom manipulators and a rough-terrain quadruped robot.},

@article{Achille2017,
abstract = {We review the problem of defining and inferring a "state" for a control system based on complex, high-dimensional, highly uncertain measurement streams such as videos. Such a state, or representation, should contain all and only the information needed for control, and discount nuisance variability in the data. It should also have finite complexity, ideally modulated depending on available resources. This representation is what we want to store in memory in lieu of the data, as it "separates" the control task from the measurement process. For the trivial case with no dynamics, a representation can be inferred by minimizing the Information Bottleneck Lagrangian in a function class realized by deep neural networks. The resulting representation has much higher dimension than the data, already in the millions, but it is smaller in the sense of information content, retaining only what is needed for the task. This process also yields representations that are invariant to nuisance factors and having maximally independent components. We extend these ideas to the dynamic case, where the representation is the posterior density of the task variable given the measurements up to the current time, which is in general much simpler than the prediction density maintained by the classical Bayesian filter. Again this can be finitely-parametrized using a deep neural network, and already some applications are beginning to emerge. No explicit assumption of Markovianity is needed; instead, complexity trades off approximation of an optimal representation, including the degree of Markovianity.},
